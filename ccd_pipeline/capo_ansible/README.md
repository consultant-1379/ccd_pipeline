# Introduction

## CCD pipeline playbooks and Ansible Vault

Most playbooks require access to data encrypted with Ansible Vault. The Vault
password must be passed in to Ansible or the playbook will fail. There are two
ways to do this.

Ansible will prompt for the password in an interactive prompt:

    ansible-playbook --ask-vault-pass <playbook-filename.yml>

Provide the path to a file containing the password for no prompt:

    ansible-playbook --vault-password-file <path_to_secret> <playbook-filename.yml>

> üìù The rest of this README uses the interactive prompt in the examples.

When running many playbooks it could be helpful to define an alias:

    alias ap='ansible-playbook --vault-password-file <path_to_secret>'

> üìù For security reasons, the password file option must not be used when
running playbooks on a shared server.
